       If you have just joined a cat in the family, perhaps you are looking for information about how you should act in the way of feeding them,
       which is very natural! However, don't panic because your pet is one of the easiest to take care of. See how simple it is to organize your kitten's food:
    </p>
 
   <ol class="list-left">
        <li>First you need to separate a space for your cat.In this space, you will put water, feed, litter box for the pet's needs, and make sure 
            you leave it as far away as possible from the water and feed bowls;</li>
        
        <li>If the cat is newborn it will be fed by the mother, at least for the first few weeks of life. If you have a stray kitten, who came from 
            a shelter without her mother or for some reason this family breakup happened, then there is a specific milk for them in PET SHOPS. 
            If it is an adult cat, the rations are sufficient. Ask the vet!</li>
        
        <li>For cats in adulthood, you should buy dry rations, as well as can offer cans. If your kitten is already old, a great tip is to give the canned
            food because as they are already having difficulty chewing the food is easier for them;</li>
        
        <li>And water, lots of water and at ease. They'll play and expend energy, so keep them hydrated.</li> 
    </ol>
  
      
   <h3 class="subtitle">A safe home</h3>

   <ol class="list-left">
       <li>The protection net for cats is one of the most important accessories. They love to live high, and that's why windows pose a huge 
           danger to them, and they may feel motivated to jump or even run away.</li>
           
       <li>Choose plants safe for cats. Not all are considered safe plants, and some are poisonous and can seriously harm the organism.</li>
       
       <li>Beware of prohibited cat food. Cats' taste buds are naturally more demanding due to the small amount of taste buds, but they may 
           still want to venture out and try new types of food. However, some foods are not well received by the animal's body, which is very 
           different from ours, and this can end up resulting in an intoxicated cat. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to the foods that cats can eat.</li>
  </ol>

   <ol class="list-left">
       <li>Regular veterinary visits is very important, beacuse they also need to go to the vet for checkups (not just when they are sick). 
           This habit is especially important to detect diseases early, and increasing the chances of curing or controlling the disease.</li>
      
       <li>Keep your cat indoors. Although many people think that cats need to live free and have access to the street, it is proven that the habit 
           reduces the animal's life expectancy: stray cats or those who take the famous walks on the roof live about 3 years less than felines who live indoors.
           The so-called indoor breeding prevents the animal from having contact with very serious diseases, such as FIV and FeLV, from suffering accidents or 
           getting hurt in fights with other animals.</li>

      <li>Cat vaccines are also critical to preventing serious illness. Also they need to be protected from the action of parasites such as fleas and ticks, so 
          be sure to keep your cat dewormer up to date.</li>
  </ol>
